It was queer because, while it was an expression of delighted excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to a kind of shock just received.</p><p>"What IS the matter?" cried two or three voices at once.</p><p>"Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?" said Lavinia, eagerly. "There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room, Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed."</p><p>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half stunned.</p><p>"I have just had this letter from Sara," she said, holding it out to let them see what a long letter it was.</p><p>"From Sara!"
