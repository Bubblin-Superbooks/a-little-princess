It's bewitched—or I'm bewitched. I only THINK I see it all." Her words began to hurry themselves. "If I can only keep on thinking it," she cried, "I don't care! I don't care!"</p><p>She stood panting a moment longer, and then cried out again.</p><p>"Oh, it isn't true!" she said. "It CAN'T be true! But oh, how true it seems!"</p><p>The blazing fire drew her to it, and she knelt down and held out her hands close to it—so close that the heat made her start back.</p><p>"A fire I only dreamed wouldn't be HOT," she cried.</p><p>She sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the rug; she went to the bed and touched the blankets. She took up the soft wadded dressing-gown, and suddenly clutched it to her breast and held it to her cheek.</p></div> </div>
