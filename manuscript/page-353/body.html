The face she saw was a shining, wonderful thing. The Princess Sara—as she remembered her—stood at her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand.</p><p>"Come," she said. "Oh, Becky, come!"</p><p>Becky was too frightened to speak. She simply got up and followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word.</p><p>And when they crossed the threshold, Sara shut the door gently and drew her into the warm, glowing midst of things which made her brain reel and her hungry senses faint. "It's true! It's true!" she cried. "I've touched them all. They are as real as we are. The Magic has come and done it, Becky, while we were asleep—the Magic that won't let those worst things EVER quite happen."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
