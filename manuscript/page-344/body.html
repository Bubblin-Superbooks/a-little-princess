It was only sad and quiet.</p><p>"I was wondering," she said in a low voice, "what MY papa would say if he knew where I am tonight."</p><p>Miss Minchin was infuriated just as she had been before and her anger expressed itself, as before, in an intemperate fashion. She flew at her and shook her.</p><p>"You insolent, unmanageable child!" she cried. "How dare you! How dare you!"</p><p>She picked up the books, swept the rest of the feast back into the hamper in a jumbled heap, thrust it into Ermengarde's arms, and pushed her before her toward the door.</p><p>"I will leave you to wonder," she said. "Go to bed this instant." And she shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling Ermengarde, and left Sara standing quite alone.</p></div> </div>
