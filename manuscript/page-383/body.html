She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the Indian gentleman's house.</p><p>"Suppose," she whispered in pleased excitementâ€”"just suppose it was the monkey who got away again. Oh, I wish it was!"</p><p>She climbed on a chair, very cautiously raised the skylight, and peeped out. It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near her, crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled itself piteously at sight of her.</p><p>"It is the monkey," she cried out. "He has crept out of the Lascar's attic, and he saw the light."</p><p>Becky ran to her side.</p><p>"Are you going to let him in, miss?" she said.</p><p>"Yes," Sara answered joyfully. "It's too cold for monkeys to be out. They're delicate. I'll coax him in."</p></div> </div>
