He did not feel any particular sympathy for irate keepers of boarding schools.</p><p>"You had better not pay for anything more, ma'am," he remarked, "unless you want to make presents to the young lady. No one will remember you. She hasn't a brass farthing to call her own."</p><p>"But what am I to do?" demanded Miss Minchin, as if she felt it entirely his duty to make the matter right. "What am I to do?"</p><p>"There isn't anything to do," said Mr. Barrow, folding up his eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket. "Captain Crewe is dead. The child is left a pauper. Nobody is responsible for her but you."</p><p>"I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!"</p></div> </div>
